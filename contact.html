      <h2>About me</h2>
      <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" width="138" height="138" class="floatleft" id="profile">
      <p>I am a mom to three children ages five, eight, and thirteen. I’ve been working with children since 1999, first as an assistant at Kid’s
      Haven Family Daycare, and now running my own child care, which I have done for the last six years.  My husband works in social services, and we share our
      home with a very child friendly cat. Both my husband and I have current criminal record checks and current first aid certificates. I have completed
      Good Beginnings for Family Child Care and am also Food Safe Certified.</p><p><br style="clear:left">Over the years, I have become familiar with various approaches to
      early childhood education, such as Montessori and Waldorf. Primarily, we follow LifeWays, a family style approach emphasizing awareness of the natural world
      and building strong relationships with children and families. With it I hope to instill a reverence for nature through gardening, nature walks, and
      celebrating the changing seasons; to inspire creativity through open ended art and music activities; and to encourage cognitive development through sensory
      experiences and educational materials.</p>

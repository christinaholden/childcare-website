      <h2 id="payment">What are your payment policies?</h2>
         <p>Tuition fees are payable by the first of each month. A late fee of $10.00 will be charged for each day that payment is received
         late. Fees are payable by cheque, cash or e-transfer; receipts are issued monthly. There is a charge for NSF cheques.</p><p>A deposit of one half your monthly rate will be required at the time
         of registration. This will pay for one half the first month's tuition fee and reserves the space for your child.</p><br>
      <h2 id="absence">Must I pay for days my child does not need to attend?</h2>
         <p>In the case of your vacation, or any temporary absence of your child (eg. illness), fees will not be refunded.</p><p>Statutory holidays are included
         in the month's payment if such a holiday falls on one of your contracted days.</p><p>Any change to originally contracted days requires one month's notice.</p><br>
      <h2 id="subsidy">Do you accept subsidy?</h2>
         <p>Absolutely.</p><p>Paperwork must be kept up to date and renewals filed promptly. The parent portion of the monthly fee is subject to all policies
         above.</p><br>
      <h2 id="sleep">Where will my child sleep?</h2>
         <p>The older children sleep together on cots. Little ones under two sleep in play yards placed in a separate room. Those who still nap twice a day will be on their own schedule until they need
         only a single nap. Sometime between the age of two and three, they will make the move to a cot.</p><br>
      <h2 id="quiet_time">My child no longer naps. Will they still be required to sleep?</h2>
         <p>We have a quiet time every day to allow young children the opportunity to nap if they need to. Those who have outgrown their nap are asked to rest quietly for a short time, after which
         they are provided with quiet, restful activities for the duration.<br><a href="#top" class="align_right">Back to top</a></p><br>
      <img src="images/garden.jpg" alt="child made garden markers" width="540" height="115" class="center">   
      <h2 id="potty">My child has begun potty training. How will this be handled in the child care?</h2>
         <p>Once potty training has begun at home, I will be prepared to work with you in continuing the process. During this time, I require that children wear waterproof training
         pants.</p><p>Once the child can announce that they need to use the potty, can stay dry for a full day, and don't refuse at potty time, we can try big kid underwear.
         If we are having too many accidents to maintain a healthy environment for all children, then we may have to return to training pants for a time.</p><br>
      <h2 id="illness">What happens if my child is sick?</h2>
         <p>Your child may be brought to child care if they have a common cold. Consistent discharge of any color other than clear, or a nose that does not seem to stop running
         excludes the child from care.</p><p>Be aware that the following ailments always exclude a child from attending care:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>fever over 37 degrees</li>
            <li>diarrhea</li>
            <li>vomiting</li>
            <li>undiagnosed rash</li>
            <li>undiagnosed sore throat or runny eyes</li>
            <li>undiagnosed aches and pains</li>
            <li>any communicable disease or ailment</li></ul>
         <p>If your child becomes ill during the day, I will attempt to contact you, or your alternate contact, to come and pick up your child. They will be kept comfortable and
         supervised until then.</p><br>
      <h2 id="closure">What happens if you become ill?</h2>
         <p>In the event of my illness or absence, I will give you as much notice as I can so that you may arrange for alternate care. You do not pay for my sick or vacation days.
         </p><p>I will also close the child care in the event my own children have significant symptoms or a communicable disease. If symptoms are minor, I may contact you and allow you to decide if you want your child to attend. If you decide
         not to, the day's fees will be refunded or credited forward.<br><a href="#top" class="align_right">Back to top</a></p><br>

      <h2 id="discipline">How will my child be disciplined?</h2>
         <p>Guidance focuses on the behavior rather than the child. Each child's individuality and level of development is considered. Limits are drawn with:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>redirection</li>
            <li>an opportunity for children to solve problems</li>
            <li>natural and logical consequences</li>
            <li>limiting the use of equipment</li>
            <li>a time away for calming down if necessary</li></ul>
         <p>If your child seems to be having a difficult time, the problem will be discussed with you so that we may work together to help them have a more positive experience.</p>
         <p>Under no circumstance will your child be:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>humiliated</li>
            <li>frightened</li>
            <li>neglected or isolated</li>
            <li>deprived of food or other basic needs</li>
            <li>slapped, spanked or roughly handled</li></ul>
         <p>Children are never reprimanded for lapses in potty training or other accidents.</p><br>

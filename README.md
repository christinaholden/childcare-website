# Childcare Website

This is a static website built for a Family Daycare Business. It's purpose was to outline the services provided by the business, 
and the policies followed by the provider. It was designed to provide the information a client would need to decide if the facility
was a good fit for their family, and give them a contact point if it was. It does this with a simple structure and clear links to each
section of information. Colors and images were chosen to reflect the atmosphere of the facility and what a child's day there might be 
like.
